* The workflow menu is removed. Workflow actions are displayed in
  the actions menu instead.

* The Add... menu (aka folder factories) can additionally display actions
  having the category ``folder_factories``.

* The Add... menu can be customized further by providing a specific adapter
  which can modify the list of factory items.
